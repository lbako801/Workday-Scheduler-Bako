## Hourly Scheduler for Work

This is a simple hourly scheduler that allows users to add and save tasks for each hour of the day. The scheduler displays the current date and time, highlights the current hour, and updates task colors depending on the time of day. Users can enter and save tasks to local storage, which are automatically loaded and displayed on page refresh.

## Usage
To use this scheduler, simply open the index.html file in your web browser if you have cloned the repo or simply head to [this webpage](https://lbako801.github.io/Workday-Scheduler-Bako/). The current date and time will be displayed at the top of the page, along with a range of hours from the open time to the close time specified in the form at the top of the page.

To add a task, simply click on the text area for the corresponding hour, enter your task, and click the "SAVE" button. The task will be saved to local storage and will automatically appear on page refresh.
