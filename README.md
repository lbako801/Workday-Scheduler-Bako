## Hourly Scheduler for Work

Welcome to my hourly scheduler, a fun way to keep track of my daily tasks! With this scheduler, I can add and save tasks for every hour of the day, ensuring that I never miss a beat. By using this scheduler, I can stay on top of my game and achieve all of my daily goals. It even displays the current date and time, highlights the current hour, and updates task colors based on the time of day, so I always have a clear view of my schedule. With the added bonus of automatically loading and displaying my saved tasks from local storage on page refresh, this scheduler makes organizing my day both easy and enjoyable. Give it a try and see how it can help you stay on top of your game too!

## Usage
To use this scheduler, simply open the index.html file in your web browser if you have cloned the repo or simply head to [this webpage](https://lbako801.github.io/Workday-Scheduler-Bako/). The current date and time will be displayed at the top of the page, along with a range of hours from the open time to the close time specified in the form at the top of the page.

To add a task, simply click on the text area for the corresponding hour, enter your task, and click the "SAVE" button. The task will be saved to local storage and will automatically appear on page refresh.
